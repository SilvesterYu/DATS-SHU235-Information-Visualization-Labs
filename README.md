# Folders and what's inside

## InfoVis_Practices
2 examples:
1. example.html: how to export fields in .js, how to import them into .html
2. face.html: how to export function in .js (face_d3.js), how to import and use function in .html (face.html)

Note: 
1. package.json, package-lock.json can be different for different folders. Best to remove them before running anything. 
2. And then, in VSCode terminal, run

(1) npm i -D webpack webpack.cli  (press Enter everytime if you just want the default vals for all the fields which is usually the case :)
  
(2) npm init (press yes for everything)
